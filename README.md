## Development Process

This project helped me learn how to use a professional Git workflow including forking a repository, creating a feature branch, and making small, meaningful commits. I implemented each feature step by step to ensure changes were easy to track and understand. Writing clear commit messages helped me document my progress effectively. Creating a detailed README showed me how important documentation is for explaining how a project works. Overall, this assignment improved my confidence using Git and GitHub for real-world projects.
